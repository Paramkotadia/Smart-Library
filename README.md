A lightweight and scalable Library Management System built with Python and Flask, designed to simplify and automate everyday library operations with a clean web interface.

## 🚀 Features
🔥 Simple and intuitive web interface (index.html)

⚡ Flask backend powering core functionality (app.py)

📁 Organized project structure for easy maintenance and extension

🔧 Easily extensible to add features like book management, user accounts, and more

💾 Stores and manages library data efficiently

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Backend: Python 3, Flask 🐍

Frontend: HTML5, Jinja2 Templates 🌐

Other Tools: Git, Virtual Environments

## 💻 Getting Started                                                    
Follow the steps below to clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the application.

__Step 1: Open Git Bash:__

Open Git Bash on your Windows system. You can find it by searching for "Git Bash" in the Start menu.

__Step 2: Navigate to Your Desired Directory:__

Change the directory to where you want to clone the repository (for example, the Desktop). Replace YourUsername with your actual system username.

cd /c/Users/YourUsername/Desktop

__Step 3: Clone the Repository:__

Clone the Smart-Library repository from GitHub using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Paramkotadia/Smart-Library.git

This will create a folder named Smart-Library in your current directory.

__Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory:__

cd Smart-Library

__Step 5: Explore the Project Files:__

List the files to get an overview of the project structure:


ls

You will typically find Python scripts (e.g., train.py, attendance.py, main.py), folders like dataset for face images, a model folder for trained model files, and a requirements.txt file containing the dependencies.

__Step 6: Install Required Dependencies:__

Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:


pip install -r requirements.txt

If the requirements.txt file is not available, you can manually install the necessary packages:

pip install opencv-python

pip install face-recognition

pip install numpy

__Step 7: Run the Application:__ 

Run the main Python script to start the application. The main script is typically named app.py. Use the following command (replace the filename if different):

python app.py

## 🧠 How It Works

The application serves a simple homepage for users to interact with the library system.

Backend routes handle requests such as adding or removing books, user management, and searching.

The Flask server communicates with the frontend through templates and API endpoints.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned features and improvements include:

__📚 Advanced Book Management:__ Adding book categories, tags, and detailed metadata

__👥 User Authentication & Roles:__ Implement user login, registration, and role-based access control (admin, member, guest)

__🔍 Enhanced Search:__ Full-text search with filters for author, genre, availability, etc.

__📊 Analytics Dashboard:__ Visualize borrowing statistics, popular books, and user activity

__🛎 Notifications:__ Email/SMS alerts for due dates, new arrivals, and overdue books

__☁ Cloud Integration:__ Host the application on cloud platforms for remote access

__📱 Mobile Friendly UI:__ Responsive design or dedicated mobile app for easy access on smartphones
